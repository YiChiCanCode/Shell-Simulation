# Shell Simulation

This repository contains a simple Shell Simulation program written in C It's designed to help students understand the working of shell commands and to provide a hands-on experience of building a shell simulation from scratch.

## Features

- Interprets and executes basic shell commands
- Implements features like command history
- Offers a simplistic UI for easy interaction

## Prerequisites

```
git clone https://github.com/YiChiCanCode/Shell-Simulation.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```
cd Shell-Simulation
```

Compile the program using a C++ compiler:

```
g++ main.cpp -o shell_simulation
```

Run the program:

```
