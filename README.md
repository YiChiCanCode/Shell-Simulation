# Shell Simulation

This repository contains a simple Shell Simulation program written in C++. It's designed to help students understand the working of shell commands and to provide a hands-on experience of building a shell simulation from scratch.

## Features

- Interprets and executes basic shell commands
- Implements features like command history
- Offers a simplistic UI for easy interaction

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local development machine:

- C++ Compiler (gcc, g++, clang, etc.)
- Git

If not, install them from your package manager (apt, brew, yum etc.)

## Installation and Running the Program

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/YiChiCanCode/Shell-Simulation.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```
cd Shell-Simulation
```

Compile the program using a C++ compiler:

```
g++ main.cpp -o shell_simulation
```

Run the program:

```
./shell_simulation
```

## Usage

Upon running the shell simulation, you will be greeted with a command prompt where you can type and execute basic shell commands. Use the `history` command to view your command history.
